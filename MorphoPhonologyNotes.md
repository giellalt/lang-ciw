#  Verb morphophonology

There are some morphophonological processes in Ojibwe, though there may be some dialect variation.

* Short final vowels in VAI go away for forms with ni- and gi- prefixes
    - Example: 
* gi- and o- alternates with gid- and od- in verb stems beginning with vowels
    - Example: 
* ni- is realized as several things depending on the initial context of the verb stem
* there are several segmental changes that occur in preterites
* Some reduplication
* -s- in negative assimilates in voicing when following the segments *n z h m*
* -m- alternates with -n- before negative -s-/-z-, also both things occur: ni-nisidotam-siin ➔ ninisidotanziin

##  ni-

* ni- ➔ ind- before vowels 
* ni- ➔ in- before *d g j z zh* 
* ni- ➔ im- before *b*

Some dialects may also have *nin-* before *gii-*, as well as there is some
dialectical variation for the whole process.

* *ni-nibaa*
* *ind-anokii*
* *in-dagoshin*
* *im-bakade*

##  Preterite segmental changes

* a ➔ e
* aa ➔ ayaa
* e ➔ aye
* i ➔ e
* ii ➔ aa
* o ➔ we
* oo ➔ waa

This process does not affect stems beginning in *dan-, dazh-, das-, dash-*, or *daa-*. These have prefix *en-*.

There are some other changes too: the place prefix *bi-* 'here, hither' ➔ *ba-*

There is also some vowel insertion between the preterite form and consonants. usually /a/?

##  Reduplication

Reduplication of certain segments occurs, somewhat complex.

```
	a    ➔   aya
	aa   ➔   aayaa
	e    ➔   eye
	i    ➔   ayi
	o    ➔   wawo, wawi
	Ca   ➔   CaCa
	Caa  ➔   CaaCaa
	Ce   ➔   CeCe
	Ci   ➔   CaCi
	Cii  ➔   CaaCii
	Co   ➔   CaCo
	Coo  ➔   CaaCoo
```
