# `excel2fst`

## Install dependencies
First, install dpendencies by `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`. This also depends on a working installation of `giella-core`. You'll get an error if you `GTCORE` enviroment variable hasn't been set.

## Build LEXC files and the Ojibwe FST

Then, run the command `make all` in the terminal to build `ojibwe.fomabin` and lexc-files.

## Run yaml tests

Run `make check`. This will print the output of the yaml tests. It will also write them into a log-file `yamltest.log` (the log-file is overwritten every time you run `make check`). 

## Run interactively

You can use `flookup` (use `cat` instead of `echo` to feed in a file of word forms):

```
% echo "zanagad" | flookup ojibwe.fomabin 
zanagad	zanagad+VII+Ind+Pos+Neu+0SgProx
```

You can also use the `foma` console:

```
% foma
