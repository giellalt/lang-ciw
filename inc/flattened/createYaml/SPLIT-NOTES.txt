GENERAL

>> marks the stem/suffix juncture
<< marks the prefix/stem juncture
Null morphemes will not be added unless a rule needs to refer to them

RULES

d-deletion
Only stem change is "zanagad", where "d" is deleted when the suffix complex starts with a consonant.

NOTES

RULES

ShortV-deletion
Delete word-final short vowels ("i" and "o" as in "niimi" and "nagamo"; this rule MUST PRECEED the "w-deletion" rule)

W-deletion
Delete word-final "w" (occurs with neutral, positive 3sg; this rule MUST FOLLOW the short-vowel-deletion rule)

Nasal deletion & vowel lengthening
With -am stems ("zaaga'am"), the stem-final "m" is deleted and the vowel "a" is elongated to "aa" when the suffix complex starts with "m" or "n"

Nasal assimilation & vowel lengthening
With stems ending in "m", so both -am and -m stems ("minongwaam" and "zaaga'am"), the "m" changes to "n" when the suffix complex starts with "z" (negation) or a "g" (3SgProx in the conjunct)

NOTES

There is a process where stem-final short finals are lengthened to the corresponding long vowels in front of the preterit morpheme "-ban". This is modelled by adding the second half of the long vowel in the suffix complex, rather than any sort of rule. Questionable, but it works.

We need to deal with prefix allomorphy (see note in VTIs)

RULES

Nasal deletion & vowel lengthening
Stem-final "m" (as in TI -am stems like "waabandam") is deleted and the penultimate vowel "a" is elongated to "aa" when the suffix complex starts with "m" or "n"

Nasal assimilation & vowel lengthening
Stem-final "m" (as in TI -am stems like "waabandam") changes to "n" when the suffix complex starts with "z" (negation) or a "g" (3SgProx in the conjunct)

With TI2 and TI3 stems (and TI4 stems in the independent order, see notes), the stem-final "n" is deleted when the suffix complex starts with a consonant.

NOTES

The TI4s like "ayaan/ayaam" are a strange bird. We need to see what Border Lakes does, but in Minnesota, according to some notes by Nichols, they behave like the TI1, TI2, and TI3s in the independent order (so as if the stem ends in an "n"), but like the -am regular TIs in the conjunct (so as if the stem ends in "m"). We don't really have full paradigms here anyway for the conjunct, so we may want to set them aside for the time being before we have more data.

We are showing different allomorphs of the prefix depending on if the stem starts in a consonant (ni, gi, o) or a vowel (ind, gid, od). We need to model this in a general way with the other allomoprhs that pop up, and make sure to model Border Lakes specificall. This also goes for the VAIs and VTAs.

RULES

For stems that end in "aw", the "aw" goes to "aa" when the suffix complex starts with "g".
For stems that end in "aw", the "aw" goes to "oo" when the suffix complex starts with "n" or "s".

For stems that end in "o", the "o" goes to "w" when the suffix complex starts with "aa"

ShortV-deletion
Delete word-final short vowels (as in the "o" in "mizho")

NOTES

"Many vta verbs show an alternation in their final consonant between /n/ and /zh/. The form /zh/ shows up before the 1st-person object theme suffix /-i/, the imperative 1st-person object theme suffix /-ishi/, and the 2nd-person imperative theme suffix, /-i/. Elsewhere the form of the final sound of such verbs is /n/." (https://ojibwegrammar.langsci.wisc.edu/Grammar/HTMLParadigms/vtaNindpos.htm)

"A few vta verbs show an alternation in their final consonant between /s/ and /sh/. The form /sh/ shows up before the 1st-person object theme suffix /-i/, the imperative 1st-person object theme suffix /-ishi/, and the 2nd-person imperative theme suffix, /-i/. Elsewhere the form of the final sound of such verbs is /s/. There is only a small number of verbs showing this alternation" (https://ojibwegrammar.langsci.wisc.edu/Grammar/HTMLParadigms/vtaSindpos.htm)
