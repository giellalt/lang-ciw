NOTES FOR FULLY FLATTENED CIW FST
By: Christopher Hammerly

GENERAL

>> marks the stem/suffix juncture
<< marks the prefix/stem juncture
Null morphemes will not be added unless a rule needs to refer to them

VII

Only stem change is "zanagad", where "d" is deleted when the suffix complex starts with a consonant.

VAI

Delete word-final short vowels ("i" and "o" as in "niimi" and "nagamo"; this rule MUST PRECEED the "w-deletion" rule)

Delete word-final "w" (occurs with neutral, positive 3sg; this rule MUST FOLLOW the short-vowel-deletion rule)

With -am stems ("zaaga'am"), the stem-final "m" is deleted and the vowel "a" is elongated to "aa" when the suffix complex starts with "m" or "n"

With stems ending in "m", so both -am and -m stems ("minongwaam" and "zaaga'am"), the "m" changes to "n" when the suffix complex starts with "z" (negation) or a "g" (3SgProx in the conjunct)


Not a rule, but a side note: There is a process where stem-final short finals are lengthened to the corresponding long vowels in front of the preterit morpheme "-ban". This is modelled by adding the second half of the long vowel in the suffix complex, rather than any sort of rule.
