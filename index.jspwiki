!!!The language

Ojibwe is an Algonquin language spoken in Canada and the United States.
There are dialect differences within the language. The principal source
of our analyser presents the Minnesota dialect, using the Double Vowel, 
or so-called Fiero system. This system is characterised by marking vowel
length by writing double vowel symbols.
