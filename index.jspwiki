These pages document our work on Ojibwe.

!!!The language

Ojibwe is an Algonquin language spoken in Canada and the United States.
There are dialect differences within the language. The principal source
of our analyser presents the Minnesota dialect, using the Double Vowel, 
or so-called Fiero system. This system is characterised by marking vowel
length by writing double vowel symbols.

!!!Sources

We have so far used the following two sources:

# The ''chart'' verb paradigms of the web page [Anishinaabemowin, Ojibwe Language|http://weshki.atwebpages.com/oj_verbs.html]
# [The article on Ojibwe grammar|http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammaire_de_l%27ojibw√©] on the French Wikipedia
# [Gikendandaa Ojibwemowin!|http://jamesastarkeyjr.com/Ojibwemowin/Pages/Index.htm] has lists of different classes of verbs in PDF format, collected from [Weshki|http://weshki.atwebpages.com] online ojibwe dictionary

Additional sources to peruse

* [Ojibwe Vocabulary Project, Working Session July 6-8, 2009|http://minnesotahumanities.org/resources/Book%20Contents.pdf]. Lots of words, but it appears that the encoding is a bit weird and thus hard to export data from the PDF.
* [Kwayaciiwiin|http://www.kwayaciiwin.com/node/15336] has some very big, free dictionaries in both latin and canadian syllabics, and verbs are marked in a roundabout way (otherwise no PoS and inflectional category information)
* Anton Truer at Bemidji state has collected a fair amount of resources and wordlists, which are published online, however it may be that he would be willing to donate plaintext wordlists as well.
