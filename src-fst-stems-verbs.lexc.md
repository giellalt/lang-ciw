Ojibwe verb stems                           

The verbs are analysed as follows:
* We split the Verb lexicon in 4 groups according to transitivity class
* For each group, we add the prefixes, and mark them with *flag diacritics* (the @ symbols)
* Then come the stems themselves
* Finally, come the suffixes, including flag diacritics
to ensure that the correct prefixes and suffixes are matched together

Prefixes and suffixes are in affixes/verbs.lexc, whereas
the stems are in stems/verbs.lexc

The Ojibwe verbs are divided in four groups:

1. IA: Intransitive animate
1. II: Intransitive inanimate
1. TA: Transitive animate
1. TI: Transitive inanimate
